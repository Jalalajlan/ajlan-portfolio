  aboutDescription:
    " From a young age, I have always had a passion for coding, fueled by the wonder of how the internet works. I used to play with custom Google blog templates using HTML and CSS and it was really fun. Fast-forwarded to today, and I turned my passion into success in building production software.<br /> <br /> I have a <b> degree in Software Engineering </b> backed up by <b>1.4 years of practical experience</b> with a focus on building robust, high-quality software and solving business problems. I've used a variety of programming languages including<b> JavaScript, Java, Dart, and PHP.</b> <br /><br />When I'm away from the computer, you'll find me at the gym, hanging out with my brother or reading a book.",
